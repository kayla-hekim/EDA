    "   ![title](img/2.png)\n",
    "3. Show that $\\text{cov}(a+bX,a+bX) = b^2 \\text{cov}(X,X) $, and in particular that $\\text{cov}(X,X) = s^2 $.\n",

    "4. Instead of the mean, consider the median. Consider transformations that are non-decreasing (if $x\\ge x'$, then $g(x)\\ge g(x')$), like $2+5 \\times X$ or $\\text{arcsinh}(X)$. Is a non-decreasing transformation of the median the median of the transformed variable? Explain. Does your answer apply to any quantile? The IQR? The range? \n",
    "    * In terms of the median, the median doesn't always satisfy g(Median(X)) = Median(g(X)). This is because the median depends on where the new middle of the dataset is. In this case, if we did g(x) = x^2, the set {1 2 3} because {1 4 9}, where the median is 4, not 2 like in the original set. The mean is slightly more \"resistant\" to this trend because it's the average of the values, not a new center value. Other transformations could cause other effects.\n",
    "    * In terms of quantiles, a quantile evaluates the position of values in relation to each other. Because of this, the quantile is not affected by changes in order under a non-decreasing transformation. But, the actual value of the quantile can change due to the transformation, similar to the median.\n",
    "    * Like the median, the IQR is not resistant to the non-decreasing transformations. Like in the g(x) = x^2 example, if we squared {1, 2, 3}, we would get {1, 4, 9} which increases the distance from median 4 to the Q1 and Q3 values, modifying the IQR range. This happens because transformations like squaring affect the spacing between values differently across the dataset.\n",
    "    * The range is not resistant to the non-decreasing transformations because we could take that same example of g(x) = x^2 where the set goes from {1, 2, 3} to {1, 4, 9}. The range of the first set is 2 while the range of the second is 8 which is different. This shows that the range is affected by the transformation and is not preserved.\n",
    "5. Consider a non-decreasing transformation $g()$. Is is always true that $m(g(X))= g(m(X))$?\n",
    "   * The mean of g(X) is not always resistant to the transformation because of its value. If we took the average of {1, 2, 3}, we receive (1 + 2 + 3)/3 = 2, but {1, 4, 9} would be (1 + 4 + 9)/3 = 4.67. This shows that the mean is not preserved under non-decreasing transformations because the factors changed. The mean changes under transformation since the values change in a non-linear way, modifying the resulting average."
